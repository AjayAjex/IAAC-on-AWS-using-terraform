# Terraform_AWS_Project
Create infrastructure on AWS using terraform - IAAC

Executed the design and deployment of a robust web application infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform. Established a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with meticulously crafted subnets across diverse availability zones. Deployed EC2 instances, each strategically placed in dedicated subnets, and seamlessly interconnected them with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for load distribution.

Implemented security measures by crafting a tailored security group to regulate incoming and outgoing traffic to the web servers. The entire infrastructure, from networking components to compute resources, was defined and provisioned with Terraform, showcasing a commitment to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

This project not only underscores proficiency in AWS and Terraform but also highlights the ability to engineer scalable, resilient, and automated cloud infrastructures for contemporary web applications.
